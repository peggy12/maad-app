## ðŸ“‹ Step-by-Step Railway Deployment

### Step 1: Open Railway
Click this link: **https://railway.app/new**

### Step 2: Login with GitHub
- Click "Login with GitHub"
- Authorize Railway to access your repositories

### Step 3: Deploy Your Repository
1. Click "Deploy from GitHub repo"
2. Search for: `peggy12/maad-app`
3. Click on your repository
4. Click "Deploy Now"

Railway will automatically:
- âœ… Detect your `Procfile`
- âœ… Install dependencies from `package.json`
- âœ… Start your webhook with `node webhook-server.cjs`

### Step 4: Add Environment Variables
Once deployed, click on your project, then:

1. Click the "Variables" tab
2. Click "New Variable"
3. Add these one by one:

```
FACEBOOK_VERIFY_TOKEN
maad_verify_2025
```

```
FACEBOOK_ACCESS_TOKEN
EAALmMutQkSQBPmw7pdLIzMMAZCtI3gOkUSNQL8xfZApuvT3rDAZCZCqjkOf16dxcDOZC8twaqRTu0rhlQI99B47c75PA9yO34hZCi4psOthLP8KN7hEmUeJTZB6wSujpAxgixUT0uKsp3OcaCQksVCzMFMNnG0soKVFhdFYOfZBKL3ZCtIYtxyebZCZAumbFAV6TbZA6YwIqA2U0MVo8PLq4bwuoEywm4jJXZCy7AycZBdFgZDZD
```

```
FACEBOOK_PAGE_ID

```

```
BASE44_API_KEY
d4c9f08499e944ef99621b19d45e9df3
```

```
BASE44_URL
https://manaboutadog.base44.app
```

4. Click "Add" for each variable

### Step 5: Get Your Production URL
1. Go to "Settings" tab
2. Scroll to "Domains"
3. Click "Generate Domain"
4. Copy your URL (looks like: `https://maad-app-production-abc123.up.railway.app`)

Your webhook callback URL will be:
```
https://[your-railway-domain].up.railway.app/webhook
```

### Step 6: Configure Facebook Messenger
Now use your Railway URL in Facebook:

1. Go to: **https://developers.facebook.com**
2. Select your MAAD app
3. Click "Messenger" in the left sidebar
4. Click "Settings"
5. Scroll to "Webhooks"
6. Click "Add Callback URL"
7. Enter:
   - **Callback URL**: `https://[your-railway-domain].up.railway.app/webhook`
   - **Verify Token**: `maad_verify_2025`
8. Click "Verify and Save"

If verification succeeds âœ…, subscribe to these events:
- âœ… `messages`
- âœ… `messaging_postbacks`
- âœ… `feed`

### Step 7: Test Your Production Webhook
Send a message to your Facebook Page and watch it respond!

You can also check the health endpoint:
